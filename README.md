# firefly-iii-investing
firefly 3 is only for personal finance, but I need a web-based app for investing as well.

I'm a neewbie, so i'll start writing everything in PHP, MySQL, HTML, js, CSS

The purpose is simple: 
To make good investments a common individual without any financial literature need to visualize things in an easy way.
With this program I want to create a simple "Investment Manager" which can be access from the web

It must be able to present multiple bank accounts (such as normal account and an investing one) with a Year-by-Year prospect of the cashflow

The user must be able to write the average of the Personal expenses and income (I'll start by only adding the total, not going into every specific transaction)
The user must be able to write each investment
The user must be able to plan the future dividends or coupons of that investment over the years
The user must be able to hypotesize the gain at the end of the investment

This way the person can have a visual and clear understanding of his/her cashflow YbY
